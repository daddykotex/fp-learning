Functionnal Programming Learning
=====

I've been using `Scala` for almost a year now. We went from a full `Java` and `mvn` and  stack (w/ Spring) to a `Scala` and `sbt`. The result have been impressive and I enjoy it very much, but it's time for me to move on to the next level. In my case, it's going to be learning functionnal programming.

A lot of the code bases at work are tainted with `Java` and it leads to some really annoying bugs. I'm pushing for a more functionnal approach but sometimes it feels like I lack the knowledge to convince my coworkers that this approach will lead to more maintainable, stable and safe code. 

This repository will contain my progress, my notes, my impression regarding the content and the libraries I use to teach myself some FP.
